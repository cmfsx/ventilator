## Overview

An organized group of professionals from multiple disciplines focused on developing an  affordable, medical grade, robust,  open source  solution to acute shortage of mechanical ventilators due to COVID-19 pandemic. We have a core developer group collaborating online from different parts of the world, to design, build, test and validate the prototype.

- Even-though the initiation of the project was due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the LibreRespire team will continue the development of this ventilator to provide this essential medical device at a fraction of the cost of a commercial ventilator to developing countries, which are in dire shortage of ventilators regardless of the COVID-19.


## Objective

To design, build and validate a mechanical ventilator which meets minimum standards for long term ventilation with the aid of 3D printed parts and easily sourced components  which can be customized for local needs.


## Design Philosophy

The design will be publicly available for
- Study
- Modify
- Distribute
- Build
- Sell the design or hardware.
