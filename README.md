## Overview

As observed in the statistics so far, unrestricted availability of mechanical ventilators to the public will likely be a key factor in the success of fighting against the COVID-19 virus in infected countries.
LibreRespire is a multi-disciplinary Sri Lankan team focused on developing an open-source design for a low cost, reliable and easily manufacturable ventilator to address this issue.

## Objective

- Design the ventilator with easily sourced/manufactured or off-the-shelf components.
- Maintain total cost of manufacture of the ventilator within affordable range, especially to support developing countries.
- ensuring a safe, reliable and robust design on par with industry standards.
